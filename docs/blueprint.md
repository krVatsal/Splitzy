- Background color: Near-white (#F5FFFA), a very light tint of green, for a clean, calming backdrop that enhances readability and avoids stark contrast.
- Accent color: Soft Yellow (#FAFAD2), slightly offset from green on the color wheel, as a gentle and unobtrusive highlight color for important actions.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text, creating a modern and neutral aesthetic.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent expense categories and actions. Use a consistent style that complements the overall fresh and modern aesthetic.
- Maintain a clear and intuitive layout with a focus on usability. Use whitespace effectively to create a balanced and uncluttered interface. Prioritize key information for easy access.
- Incorporate subtle animations for user feedback and transitions. Use animations sparingly to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
